# Mesto

## Project work 3.

1. Project work "Mesto" (sprint 12).

2. An interactive page where you can add photos, delete them, put likes. The logic is written in JavaScript (appearance of pop-up windows, form validation, adding cards, etc.). In the *5th sprint* we implemented opening/closing and pop-up functionality for adding elements, removing them, as well as pop-up with a lightbox image. In *6th sprint* we developed form validation and improved UX when working with pop-ups. *Sprint 7* - code refactoring, getting started with OOP and modules (added Card and FormValidator classes). *8 sprint* - code rewritten in accordance with OOP, modular code built using Webpack. *9 sprint* - the site is connected to api. Improved ux/ui components.
The project is fully ported to React JS (*10-11 sprints*).
In this work (*12th sprint*), the ability to register and authorize using routing has been added, work with localStorage and JWT has been implemented (layout in JSX has been prepared in advance).
